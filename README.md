For those times when weather dictates whether a trip is feasible.

Goal
====
Produce historical weather averages for a given series of locations and dates.
Less abstractly, for a given route e.g. thru-hike, cycling tour, with start and
end dates, return a day-by-day historical average of the weather at each location.

Weather APIs to consider
========================

* [forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2)
* [wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs)
* [yahoo weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html)

_[weathersource](https://developer.weathersource.com/) looks to have exactly what we need - 10 year averages by lat/lng, but it's $2,250/month!_
